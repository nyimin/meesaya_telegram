Troubleshooting,"Error 04 on Growatt Inverter indicates Low Battery Voltage. Check if battery is charged, check breaker."
Troubleshooting,"Error 08 on Growatt Inverter indicates Bus Voltage High. Restart the inverter. If persistent, panels might be over-voltage."
Troubleshooting,"Error 20 on Deye Inverter means Battery Communication Error. Check BMS cable and protocol settings (CAN/RS485)."
Troubleshooting,"Inverter Fan Noise: It is normal for fans to run at high speed when charging over 30Amps. Ensure good ventilation."
Market,"Solar panel prices (Dec 2024): Jinko/Longi 550W ~ 280,000 MMK. 600W Bifacial ~ 310,000 MMK."
Market,"Lithium Battery Prices: 100Ah 48V (Rack) ~ 2,200,000 MMK. 200Ah 48V (Wall) ~ 4,500,000 MMK."
Maintenance,"For Lead-Acid (Tubular) batteries, check distilled water levels every month. Do not let it dry out."
Maintenance,"Clean solar panels every 2-3 weeks in dry season to maintain efficiency. Dust can reduce output by 15%."
General,"Standard grid voltage in Myanmar fluctuates between 160V and 260V. Servo stabilizer recommended."
General,"For 3kW systems, usually a 24V battery bank is used. For 5kW and above, 48V system is standard."
Glossary,"DoD (Depth of Discharge): How much energy you use. Lithium can handle 80-90% DoD. Lead Acid only 50% DoD."
Glossary,"Hybrid Inverter: Can mix Solar, Grid, and Battery. Can work without Grid. Best for Myanmar."
Policy,"Grid Feed-in is generally not allowed in residential areas using standard analog meters (it spins backwards)."
product_manual,"Growatt SPF 5000 ES: Max PV Input 450V. Max Charging 100A. Works without battery (but not recommended for unstable grid)."
